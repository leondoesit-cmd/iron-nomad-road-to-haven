/**
 * Authored city layouts.
 *
 * A procedural city leg is a boulevard down the middle of the world with randomly sized building strips on either side
 * and cross streets between the blocks. A city plan keeps that same skeleton (so physics, zombies, camps and set pieces
 * all keep working) but replaces the dice with a hand-drawn map: named streets, fixed block lengths, fixed strip widths
 * and landmark lots, so a real place can be recreated.
 *
 * Frame: the drivable spine runs north along +z at x = 0. `side` +1 is +x, which is on the driver's left when heading north
 * (three.js looks down -z, so with +z as forward, +x is to the left); `side` -1 is on the right. Everything is in metres.
